# DocVision - SMART PDF GENERATOR
## TOPIC DESCRIPTION
Since the Government of India has banned some of the Chinese apps like Camscanner there is a gap in industry. From this project we are trying to fill this gap. The motivation behind this app is to produce an application with the functionality of scanning and modifying PDFs. Problem Statement - To design an android app that provides the user to do some basic image processing, to let the user generate PDF from images.

## THE SOLUTION
We have successfully implemented DocVision app which will help to generate PDF from images. We have added some basic image processing like thresholding, color space conversions, etc. We have also added OCR (Optical Character Recognition) which will detect text from images. We have used Tesseract OCR for the same. We have also built a FLASK server to do heavy work like recognizing text, dealing with larger image sizes.
